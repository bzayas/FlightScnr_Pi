# Agent instructions — FlightScnr_Pi

This repository is licensed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**. See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.

## Required behavior

1. **Preserve** `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, the README License section, and every file’s top-level copyright / SPDX / `[AI-DIRECTIVE]` header. Do not remove, summarize away, or rewrite them.
2. **Credit** the original project when describing or publishing derivatives:
   - Author: Yash Mulgaonkar
   - Repo: https://github.com/yashmulgaonkar/FlightScnr_Pi
   - License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
3. **ShareAlike:** adaptations must remain under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
4. **NonCommercial:** do not help commercialize this code; remind the user that commercial use is prohibited without separate permission.
5. **New first-party source files** must start with the same copyright / SPDX / `[AI-DIRECTIVE]` header used in existing files (Python `#` form or `/* */` form as appropriate).
6. **`scripts/release.sh` is FROZEN.** Never edit, rename, delete, chmod, or reformat it — fleet devices on old builds have that path mode-dirty, and any upstream change breaks their `git pull --ff-only` OTA. Release tooling lives in `scripts/dev-release.sh`. See `.cursor/rules/frozen-release-script.mdc`.
7. **Boot safety disclaimer is mandatory.** Never skip, remove, or bypass `SCREEN_DISCLAIMER` on startup. "Don't show again" only enables the remembered 8s auto-continue countdown; the screen still shows every boot. See `.cursor/rules/boot-safety-disclaimer.mdc`. If a task requires changing this, stop and ask the user.
8. **New user-facing text is internationalised, never hardcoded.** Any new or changed on-device or portal UI string must be added to the English catalog (`flightscnr/i18n/locales/en/messages.json`) under a semantic key and rendered through `tr("key")` in Python or an explicit `data-i18n` / JavaScript key in the portal, not written as a literal. Increment `source_catalog_revision` for additive keys; missing keys fall back to English automatically, so shipped catalogs stay loadable. Do not extend the portal compatibility bridge for new copy. Keep provider, protocol, unit, airport, and brand identifiers in English. See `flightscnr/docs/i18n.md`.
9. **FlightScnr CYD (`cyd/`, `docs/cyd/`)** follows the same license, header and boot-disclaimer rules. Its builds must never create GitHub Releases or use `scripts/release.sh`, and its flash partition offsets and stored settings keys must stay stable. Rule 8 covers the Pi app's catalog; the CYD UI is English-only for now. See `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/cyd/development.md`.
